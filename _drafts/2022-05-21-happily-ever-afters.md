I haven't read any fiction since 2018, but I decided recently that I really wanted to read romance novels. They're like business books in that you have to try two or three in order to find a good one. Here are a few I've enjoyed:

* Helen Hoang: _The Kiss Quotient_
* Penny Reid: _Kissing Tolstoy_
* Jennifer Crusie: _Bet Me_
* Ali Hazelwood: _The Love Hypothesis_
* Erin Sterling: _The Ex Hex_
