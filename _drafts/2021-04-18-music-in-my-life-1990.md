In 1990 I was 10 years old. I was one of those kids who was really serious about collecting things -- action figures, baseball cards, book series. In 1990 I started collecting singles on cassette. It was also the year I discovered MTV; I had to watch it surreptitiously, because my mother didn't approve.

I still enjoy some of the music from the early 1990s. It feels fresh and bright in a way that music from my teenage years doesn't.
