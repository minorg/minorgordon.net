This weekend I went to [Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/sessions.html) in St. Louis, my first time there. I went to some great talks:

* Simon Peyton Jones on [computing education](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/shaping-our-childrens-education-in-computing.html). Simon gives a talk every year to first year Ph.D. students on ["how to write a great research paper"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/).
* Philip Wadler on [category theory](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/categories-for-the-working-hacker.html).
* Scott Fradkin on [musical steganography](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/musical-steganography-hiding-things-in-music.html).
* Peter Teichman on [synthesizing a Hammond B-3](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/soul-from-scratch-designing-a-more-portable-organ.html).
