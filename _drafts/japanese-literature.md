Reading [this obituary of Donald Keene](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/24/donald-keene-renowned-scholar-of-japanese-literature-dies-aged-96) reminded me of roaming the stacks of the Bizzell Library at the University of Oklahoma, browsing for new books about things I knew nothing about. I discovered 20th century Japanese literature that way: [Natsume Soseki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_S%C5%8Dseki), [Eiji Yoshikawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiji_Yoshikawa), [Kobo Abe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Db%C5%8D_Abe), [Yukio Mishima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima).
