(TODO: add short notes why they're a favorite)

### Programming languages

* Hoare: "An axiomatic basis for computer programming"

XXX

* Stroustrup: "How can you be so certain?"

### Systems

* Lauer and Needham: "On the duality of operating system structures"

XXX

* Larus and Parkes: "Using cohort scheduling to enhance server performance"
* Welsh, Culler, and Brewer: "SEDA: an architecture for well-conditioned, scalable Internet services"

These two papers were the foundations of my graduate research.
