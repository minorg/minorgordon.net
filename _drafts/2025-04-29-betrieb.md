Einstein biography passage

It's easy to get caught up in the activity of solving problems and neglect to consider whether they're worth solving
It's particularly easy for young people who don't have enough experience to distinguish what's worthwhile and what's not
As you get older and your time is more limited you become more conscientious about wasting effort

Artificial constraints. Can build a career on them.

Jobs that shouldn't exist. Bullshit jobs. Graeber. High effort + low impact is a feature (banks and other bureaucracies).

Projects with no goals.

Technical and organizational debt. Maybe better off finding some other organization than one that's committed to bad mistakes. Same principle applies to management -- managing squeaky wheels instead of doing creative work.

Reinvention. Can usually do 10-20% better on almost anything with the benefit of hindsight.

Social pressure.
