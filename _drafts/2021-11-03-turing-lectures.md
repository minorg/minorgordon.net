As part of my [plan to read more primary sources]({% post_url 2021-10-17-ask-historians %}) I've prioritized some reading that's been on my list for a number of years, starting with the [Turing lectures](https://amturing.acm.org/lectures.cfm). That was an easy choice.

Choosing favorites is more challenging, since the lectures are all excellent. I'm partial to those that are more personal and idiosyncratic:
