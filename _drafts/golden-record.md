I recently read William Poundstone's biography of Carl Sagan, which spurred me to read about the [Golden Record](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/whats-on-the-record/music/). A good soul has created a [playlist of its tracks](https://open.spotify.com/user/ulyssestone/playlist/6pcuzwZSIw7OgL149bgJmZ?si=S5Erypx5TBm4OYKSTD8JdA) on Spotify.

The PBS series [American Epic](https://www.pbs.org/show/american-epic/) has a fascinating interview about the record, as well.
