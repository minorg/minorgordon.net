Like most kids I spent my early years listening to the music my parents listened to. Like most adults my parents preferred the music that was popular when they were in high school and college. In their case that was from the mid-1960s until the mid-1970s, a great time for popular music.

- Sam and Dave: "Hold On, I'm Comin'"
- Otis Redding: "(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay"
- Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons: "December, 1963 (Oh What a Night!)"
- The Temptations: "My Girl"
- The Beach Boys: "I Get Around"
- The Righteous Brothers: "Unchained Melody"
- The Beatles: _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_
- The Supremes: "Where Did Our Love Go"
- Bob Seger: _Hollywood Nights_
- Leon Russell: _Will O' The Wisp_

And many others I can still recall. I would return to my parents' music frequently in later years. In hindsight I feel like the music they grew up is far better than the music I grew up with, but of course I didn't feel that way at the time.
