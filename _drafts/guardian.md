[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com) is my main source of news these days. I also read several of their columns and features regularly.

* John Crace's [Digested read](https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/digestedread)
* Oliver Burkeman's [This column will change your life](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/thiscolumnwillchangeyourlife). His book _The Antidote_ is also great.
* [Blind date](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date)
* [The long read](https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read), long-form essays
* The [Books section](https://www.theguardian.com/books)
* [Obituaries](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries). I love to learn about interesting people's lives.
* The [Experience](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/experience),  [A letter to ...](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/aletterto), and [What I'm really thinking](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/what-im-really-thinking) series
* The [How we made](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/how-we-made) series
