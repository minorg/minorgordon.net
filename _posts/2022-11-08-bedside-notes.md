* "No one should be a freelance writer who isn't naturally irresponsible. ... To support your wife and children on a regular and predictable food supply, in a predictable housing, with predictable supply of clothes -- if you feel such regularities are important ... then you aren't cut out to be a freelance writer." - John W. Campbell, in a letter to Ben Bova

* "My personality is too cold. ... Friendship with me seems to require a mutual, friendly respect, something I can build up only in certain limited types of people. ...
