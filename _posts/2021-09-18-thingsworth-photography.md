### [What](#what)

"Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography))

### [Why](#why)

I learned about cameras and photography so that I could take better photographs of my family, but I found that I also enjoyed photography for its own sake. It encourages you to visually examine things that normally escape our attention and look at the world in different ways.

### [How](#how)

My father-in-law Gale Farley is a photographer. He gave me a starter camera kit six or seven years ago. I went to beginner and intermediate classes at [Reiman Gardens](https://www.reimangardens.com/) in Ames, Iowa. After a short lecture we would venture into the gardens and practice, with the teacher critiquing our work. I love botanical gardens.

I've found a few books that are worth learning from, as well, like _The Practice of Contemplative Photography_ and Ansel Adams's guide. I've also learned by studying photographers whose work I enjoy, like [Aaron Siskind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Siskind) and [Minor White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_White).

Beyond that it's a matter of intentional practice: composing a shot, thinking about the lighting, etc. rather than simply taking snapshots.
