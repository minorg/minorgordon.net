The Guardian's Art & design section has a [tribute to the career of Milton Glaser](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jun/27/milton-glaser-why-the-new-york-graphic-designer-was-so-influential), who died on Friday.

> For New York magazine, which he co-founded in 1968, he co-wrote the 'Underground Gourmet' column, on the city’s cheap ethnic restaurants. 'The world is a very astonishing place,' he said in old age. 'What I feel fortunate about is that I am still astonished, that things still amaze me. The possibility for learning never disappears.'
>
> He liked to tell of his childhood experience of being bedridden with rheumatic fever. 'The only thing that kept me alive,' he said, was his mother bringing him a daily supply of modelling clay, which he would make into 'little universes', that he would then destroy and remake. The point he took into his professional life was always to create things anew, 'to keep moving and not get stuck in my own past'.>
>
> Again and again, he stressed the importance of continuing to learn. 'We are all born with genius,' he said. 'It’s like our fairy godmother. But what happens in life is that we stop listening to our inner voices, and we no longer have access to this extraordinary ability to create poetry.'
