Last week I read an [interview in The Guardian with James Fox](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/28/james-fox-keith-richards-has-a-fantastic-memory), the ghostwriter behind the memoirs of Keith Richards and David Bailey. The interviewer asked Fox what books are on his bedside table. I hadn't heard of any of the authors he lists, except Joan Didion, whose writing I love.

Fox also mentions [Lapham's Quarterly](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/), a "magazine of history & ideas". It's amazing. I just subscribed.
