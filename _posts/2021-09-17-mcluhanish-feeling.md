> I had a very McLuhanish feeling about media and environments: that once we've shaped tools, in his words, they turn around and "reshape us." Of course this is a great idea if the tools are really good and aimed squarely at the issues in question. But the other edge of the sword cuts as deep -- that inadequate tools and environments still reshape our thinking in spite of their problems, in part, because we want paradigms to guide our goals.
