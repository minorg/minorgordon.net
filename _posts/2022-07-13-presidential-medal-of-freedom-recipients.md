I've been reading the Wikipedia pages of [Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom_recipients).

The medals are "for especially meritorious contribution to (1) the security or national interests of the United States, or (2) world peace, or (3) cultural or other significant public or private endeavors." The Kennedy and Johnson recipients included a largely fraction of high cultural figures than in later years.

On the other hand, I consider that the 1960s were the peak of American intellectual life, thanks to the influx of European immigrants in the 1930s and 1940s. The lists of Kennedy and Johnson recipients reflects that: Edward Steichen, Rudolf Serkin, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Reinhold Niebuhr, Willem de Kooning. There were plenty of native-born cultural recipients, too, like Andrew Wyeth, E.B. White, and Aaron Copland.
