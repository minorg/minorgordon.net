A few years ago I went to a traveling exhibition at the Des Moines Art Center called [_Halston and Warhol: Silver and Suede_](https://www.warhol.org/exhibition/halston-and-warhol-silver-and-suede/). Valerie Steele gave a [lecture about the designer](https://www.desmoinesartcenter.org/calendar/eid/154085471EC56908/other/Lecture-) as part of the opening.

Today The Guardian published an article on [Halston's legacy](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/05/halston-70s-disco-designer-rise-fall-bianca-jagger-iman-studio-54). I didn't know that Halston designed the famous pillbox hat worn by Jackie Kennedy.

I have a couple of Halston's diffusion-line ultrasuede jackets from the 70s that I found in thrift stores. I like wearing jackets from that era. They fit  the body much better than a lot of today's off-the-rack clothes do.
