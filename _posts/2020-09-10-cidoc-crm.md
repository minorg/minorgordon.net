description: Exploring the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)
---

I've been exploring the [CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) with an eye toward using it in [Paradicms]({% post_url 2020-08-23-paradicms %}). The CRM is an abstract data model for cultural heritage information. It specifies the semantics of an entity class hierarchy and a hierarchy of properties that entities can have.

Syntax is left to implementors. A group in Erlangen has published an [OWL implementation](http://erlangen-crm.org/) of the CRM. I've seen examples in an ad hoc XML syntax, as well. Beyond that guidance and examples for implementors are hard to come by.

One way I learn new technologies is by relating them to technologies I already know. Over the long weekend I wrote a [script](https://github.com/minorg/cidoc-crm-types) to translated the Erlangen CRM OWL to Python 3 `@dataclass` definitions for entities and properties. The CRM hierarchies are directed graphs with multiple inheritance rather than simple trees. There are a few places that ran afoul of Python's rules for multiple inheritance (MRO serialization), which required some tricks to circumvent.

A team at the Getty has done something [similar](https://github.com/thegetty/crom), translating a different version of the CRM into Python using metaclasses to generate entity and property classes at runtime, rather than pre-generating .py files as I do. I prefer the latter approach because having the classes on disk makes it easier for IDEs like PyCharm to provide autocomplete and other support for exploring the code.
