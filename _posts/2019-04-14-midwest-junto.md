This weekend I went to the meeting of the [Midwest Junto for the History of Science](https://midwestjunto.wordpress.com/) in Kansas City. The history of science and technology is my favorite subject. I've read broadly in it, and I took several classes as an undergraduate, but I'd never been to a conference.

There were several talks I really enjoyed:

* Kathleen Sheppard's "Constant Companions and Intimate Friends: Female Creative Couples in the History of Archaeology"
* Alejandro Alvarado's "Animal Regeneration and the Evolution of Thought in Biology"
* Rienk Vermij's "An attempt to rehabilitate the Scientific Revolution"
* Peter Soppelsa's "From Rat War to Rat Control: Shifting Logics of Pest and Plague Response"

It was also my first trip to Kansas City since I was young. The first night I ate at [Arthur Bryan's Barbeque](https://www.arthurbryantsbbq.com/), and then I went to the [Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art](https://www.nelson-atkins.org/). There is a wonderful single-room gallery there called the "Pastel Cabinet" which was exceptionally well curated. The current installation was [_Creatures of the Night: Women in Paris from 1850-1900_](https://www.nelson-atkins.org/events/creatures-of-the-night/).
