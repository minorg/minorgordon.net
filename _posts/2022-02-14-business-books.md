I've been reading business books again in an effort to better understand the roles of my colleagues. A product manager at work recommended _Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love_. It's the kind of overview I was looking for, one that doesn't get too far into the weeds but isn't so superficial that you don't learn anything.

Another colleague recommended _Blue Ocean Strategy_. Like most business books it has a lot of filler and redundancy, but I appreciated the concrete parts. I'm not reading solely for information, but also to learn some of the vocabulary for describing problems I don't deal with every day.

Michael Stonebraker mentions _The Innovator's Dilemma_ in his Turing award lecture. That had been on my list for a while, so I borrowed a copy from the library. I can see why Christensen's book is so highly regarded, despite being a bit dated and having the redundancy you find in "journal paper sandwiches" from business school presses.

Business books being what they are, I had to sample two or three for every one I liked. I tried to read _The Lean Startup_, for example. It's a book that could have been a blog post, or simply quoted a few passages from _The Innovator's Dilemma_, which was published 14 years earlier.
