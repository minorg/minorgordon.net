description: An Awesome List of books, videos, and other resources for learning about the history of software engineering
layout: post
title:  "Awesome Software Engineering History"
---

I recently put together a list of resources (books, videos, websites) for practicing software engineers who'd like to learn more about the history of the discipline: [Awesome Software Engineering History](https://github.com/minorg/awesome-software-engineering-history). I'm not a historian, but the history of software engineering is one of my favorite subjects, and I've read widely in it for decades. I deeply enjoy knowing why the tools I use, like programming languages, are the way they are. I enjoy sharing that knowledge with others even more.

The list is geared towards new and practicing software engineers, rather than professional historians. The sources are secondary and tertiary rather than primary, "history" rather than "historical".
