Earlier this month The Guardian [published a profile of Joan Didion](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/08/california-cool-and-magical-thinking-joan-didion-at-86) and reprinted one of her essays, "Why I Write":

> "... In short my attention was always on the periphery, on what I could see and taste and touch, on the butter, and the Greyhound bus. During those years I was traveling on what I knew to be a very shaky passport, forged papers: I knew that I was no legitimate resident in any world of ideas. I knew I couldn't think. All I knew then was what I couldn't do. All I knew then was what I wasn't, and it took me some years to discover what I was."

> "Which was a writer."
>
> "By which I mean not a 'good' writer or a 'bad' writer but simply a writer, a person whose most absorbed and passionate hours are spent arranging words on pieces of paper. Had my credentials been in order I would never have become a writer. Had I been blessed with even limited access to my own mind there would have been no reason to write. I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear."

I love reading Joan Didion's essays, like "In Bed" from her collection _The White Album_. But I feel a little metacognition like the passage above goes a long way. Writers love writing about their craft. Last week I posted about [Zinsser's _Writing to Learn_]({% post_url 2021-02-06-writing-to-learn %}), and recommended his _On Writing Well_. This week [Oliver Burkeman's _Imperfectionist_ newsletter](https://www.oliverburkeman.com) was about "How to make writing less hard". One of my favorite non-fiction writers, Robert Caro, published a book in 2019 about the craft of biographical research and writing. I'm sure I'd learn something from it, but given a choice, I would rather read one of Caro's biographies than read about the process of writing them. I have the same attitude toward books by famous scientists that purport to answer Big Questions for a lay audience. Their work itself is thought-provoking enough.
