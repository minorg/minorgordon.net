This week I watched a great documentary on [rare booksellers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Booksellers). The final scene is a discussion filmed in the [Grolier Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grolier_Club), a "private club and society of bibliophiles" in New York City. I didn't know this existed. I looked it up to find out if there was some connection to the [Grolier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grolier) encyclopedia publisher. Apparently they were both named after [Jean Grolier de Servi√®res](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Grolier_de_Servi%C3%A8res), but are otherwise unconnected.
