A second set from last week's CSA. I put too many stems in the kenzan bowl again, so the photos focus on just a few blooms.

For the first photo I angled the camera diagonally across the arrangement to capture a swath of flowers. You can see the bowl in the lower left corner. I like how the image came out.
