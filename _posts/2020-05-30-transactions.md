Recently I felt a sudden need to re-acquire two books I gave away before returning from Germany to the U.S. a decade ago. Although I'm not a very materialistic person in general, I have strong attachments to books that have influenced me or that represent something I value highly.

The first book was [Jim Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gray_(computer_scientist)) 's _Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques_. Ten years ago I was working on distributed systems, and I studied Gray's book closely; although it was published in 1992 and I was working in 2009-2010, _Transaction Processing_ remained the best treatment of its subject. Like David MacKay's _Information Theory_, _Transaction Processing_ is both well-written and challenging to read. I still remember the shock of Gray's disappearance in 2007, just as I was starting to appreciate his work.

The second was _A Book of Dreams_ by Peter Reich, the son of [Wilhelm Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich). I had learned about Wilhelm Reich in college, but I didn't know about his son's book until I saw the video for Kate Bush's ["Cloudbusting"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudbusting), which is supposed to take place at [Orgonon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgonon).
