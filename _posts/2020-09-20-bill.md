Most of the [booksellers documentary]({% post_url 2020-09-20-grolier %}) was filmed in New York City. There is one scene of a person riding a bicycle along a city street with two large books strapped to the back. The scene reminded me of the 2010 documentary about [Bill Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cunningham_(American_photographer)), [_Bill Cunningham New York_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cunningham_New_York). Bill was still riding a bicycle around Manhattan a month before he died at age 87, in 2016.

Bill would come to the large gallery openings at the [Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Institute_of_Technology#The_Museum_at_FIT). I saw him at the opening of the [Ivy Style](http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/ivy-style.php) exhibition in 2012.
