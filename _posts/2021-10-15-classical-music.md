### [What](#what)

"Classical music is a term that most commonly refers to the formal musical tradition of the Western world, considered to be distinct from Western folk music or popular music traditions. ...  It includes both sacred (religious) and secular music. In contrast to most popular styles that adopted the song (strophic) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the symphony, concerto, fugue, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera, cantata, and mass." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music))

### [Why](#why)

I enjoy many different genres of music, and I'll often listen to several on any given day. I like to listen to classical music in the morning, when I'm most alert, and in the evening while I'm preparing for bed. Our local classical station WMHT plays pieces that suits the time of day. I also like [BBC Radio 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_3).

Classical music can be intellectually challenging, emotionally appealing, spiritual. The more you listen and learn, the more you get out of it.

### [How](#how)

I started listening to classical music as a teenager. From 1996 to 2000 Tulsa had a full-time station devoted to classical music, KCFM at 94.1 FM, as well as several other stations that occasionally played it. I realize now that KCFM wasn't a particularly good introduction to the music, but it was accessible.

I became a slightly more serious listener in college, and occasionally went to concerts. I could check out recordings from the library and listen to them at home, which exposed me to more modern and experimental works that wouldn't normally be played on the radio.

In Europe there were more people who were serious about classical music, much more serious than I was and am. [Dussmann](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulturkaufhaus_Dussmann) in Berlin had an entire floor devoted to classical music. I was lucky to meet a few of those people, and learn from them. 

I've also read various books about classical music: histories, biographies, memoirs. I like Harold Schonberg's _Great_ series (_Great Composers_, _Great Conductors_, et al.), despite his bombastic style.

Over time I've learned how to listen more closely and get more out of the music. I've learned which labels have consistently produced high-quality recordings. I've learned about the context in which some of the music was composed. I've learned that some conductors, orchestras, and performers are better at playing the music of certain composers than others. I love Glenn Gould's famous recordings of Bach, for example, but there are much better performances of Romantic-era pieces.

The best thing about it is there is always more to learn, more than I could fit in a lifetime.
