A second set, four days later. It rained last night and continued into the morning. The light was perfect again, but I had to wait until the rain stopped to get the camera out. I've been reminded how tough it is to get a decent photo of an arrangement without artificial lighting and a backdrop. There's rarely an obvious focal point. Macroscopic would be easier, but I find that less interesting.

I like the tangle of green in the stems and leaves.
