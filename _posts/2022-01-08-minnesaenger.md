While cleaning up my document archive I came across this old resume from 2001. I was 20 years old. Then as now I found the dryness of the resume format to be a source of frustration &mdash; not to mention the fact that in 2001 I didn't have much to advertise. Subverting the format was a way of venting that frustration. I don't recall sending this bit of cheekiness anywhere, although it wouldn't have been totally out of character.

### Minor Gordon - Minnes&#228;nger

  
#### Objective
> ... if only we arrange our life according to that principle which counsels us that we must always hold to the difficult, then that which now still seems to us the most alien will become what we most trust and find most faithful. - Rilke

I would like to find (or create) a job in which I can apply myself to challenges big and small, and in which I can grow both personally and professionally.

Does that sound too idealistic? Well... I’d also like to have a huge library with lots and lots and lots of books and lots of cats to help me read the books. I’ll need money to buy the books, and food for the cats. Cats can’t eat books.

#### Education

20 years and counting.

#### Knowledge

Lots.

#### Experience

> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, con a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects - Robert Heinlein

And I can wash dishes. And pick weeds. And think.

I can also type fast.
