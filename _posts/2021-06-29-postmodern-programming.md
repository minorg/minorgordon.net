A few years ago I stumbled across a paper by one of my former classmates, Stephen Kell, titled ["Some were meant for C: the endurance of an unmanageable language"](https://2017.onward-conference.org/details/onward-2017-essays-2017/3/Some-Were-Meant-For-C-The-endurance-of-an-unmanageable-language). That was the first I'd heard of the [Onward! Symposium on New Ideas in Programming and Reflections on Software](https://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/Onward/) at SPLASH/OOPSLA. Since then I've been sporadically picking my way through the proceedings, starting with the essays tracks and the Most Notable Paper Awards.

It's an embarrassment of riches. A few of my favorites so far:
* ["Designed as designer"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1449813) and the 2019 response ["Learning to listen for design"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359591.3359738)
* ["Selfie and the basics"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3133850.3133857)
* ["The cuneiform tablets of 2015"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2814228.2814250)
* ["Notes on postmodern programming"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1052883.1052890)
* ["I throw itching powder at tulips"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2661136.2661155)
* ["Towards a theory of conceptual design for software"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2814228.2814248)
* ["The left hand of equals"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2986012.2986031)
* ["Rubber ducks, nightmares, and unsaturated predicates: proto-scientific schemata are good for agile"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869459.1869534)
