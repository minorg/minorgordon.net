This morning The Guardian published a [great interview with Ken Burns](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jul/18/ken-burns-i-felt-that-hemingways-uber-masculinity-was-a-mask).

> **Among your frequent collaborators is the actor Peter Coyote, who often narrates your films. What does he bring to the mix?**
>
> I love Peter like a brother. He’s an extraordinary reader. And he has this amazing gift – we never send him anything in advance. He reads it cold the first time. And I swear to you, it’s take one or take two that is usually what’s in there. His voice is close to mine, though clearly with the timbre and qualities that a professional actor brings to it. He’s immensely interested in our subjects and he has the ability to inhabit the word.

Earlier in the week there was a [long profile of Will Shortz](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jul/15/will-shortz-new-york-times-crossword-editor-interview), the New York Times’s crossword editor.

> At 14, Shortz sold his first puzzle. At 16, he began contributing to puzzle magazines. In college, where he did a self-designed major, he earned the world’s first degree in enigmatology, the study of puzzles. He also did a law degree, but never took the bar, because he went immediately into a career in puzzles.
