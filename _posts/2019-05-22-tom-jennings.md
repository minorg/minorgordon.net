Over the last few days I've been reading Wikipedia articles about [BBSs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system). I started my first BBS in 1993, and soon joined [FidoNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet). I'd heard of [Tom Jennings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Jennings), but I didn't know he did so many interesting things besides Fido.
