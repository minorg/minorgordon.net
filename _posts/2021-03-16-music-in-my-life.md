Lately I've been listening to Spotify "All Out", "Best Of", and Billboard year-by-year playlists from the late 1980s and early 1990s, around the time I started developing my own taste in music. 

I'm going to start a series of posts here chronicling the music I listened to year after year, with a brief preamble about what was happening in my life at the time. It's another exercise in personal history, like "things worth learning", with a similar purpose -- to share things while I still remember them well.
