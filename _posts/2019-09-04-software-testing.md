This evening I gave a talk on [software testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQuT8zVukr0) at RPI. I modeled it after an informal talk last year by the Director of Technology at Asemio, Floyd May.

The title paraphrases one of my dad's favorite quotes: "Go early, stay late, and keep your bait in the water." It was the catch phrase of [Joe Krieger](http://tulsatvmemories.com/kvoo/kvkrieg.html), who hosted a fishing show on a Tulsa-area TV station in the 1960s.
