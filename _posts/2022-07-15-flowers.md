This week I purchased a handmade vase from Flower Scout for the weekly CSA. It was made by the same person (Sara at Golden Earth Designs) who created the kenzan bowl.

The vase is beautiful. Colie arranged the flowers in it, and she's as good at that as you would expect, so I left everything in place and photographed a few flowers as-is.

I like the shapes in the last photo, slightly abstracted.
