> "Pickles are the enemy of the human race. There is absolutely nothing that can be said in favour of them. There is something peculiar and abnormal in the craving for them, and this is especially true of school children, who, of all persons, ought to be the last to eat them."

Mrs Humphry, _How to be Pretty Though Plain_, p. 42
