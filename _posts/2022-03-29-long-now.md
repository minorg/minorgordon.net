description: The Long Now Foundation and John Markoff's new biography of Stewart Brand
---

Since I finished [reading and watching the Turing lectures]({% post_url 2022-01-12-turing-lectures %}) I've been listening to the [Long Now Foundation's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Foundation) monthly [Seminars About Long-term Thinking](https://longnow.org/seminars/), hosted by [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand). I've followed the Long Now Foundation sporadically since it was established in 1996, and have shared [their collection of essays](https://longnow.org/essays/) with friends and colleagues many times over the years, but I wasn't aware of the seminars until recently.

I've also been reading [John Markoff's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Markoff) new biography of Stewart Brand, _Whole Earth: the Many Lives of Stewart Brand_. Brand is a fascinating figure. In the 1960s alone he studied photography under [Minor White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_White) (one of my favorite photographers), appeared in Tom Wolfe's [_The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electric_Kool-Aid_Acid_Test), and operated a camera at [The Mother of All Demos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos). He went on to publish [_The Whole Earth Catalog_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog) and [_CoEvolution Quarterly_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoEvolution_Quarterly), co-found the [WELL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL), and co-chair the Long Now Foundation.

Brand deserves a better biography than Markoff has written. I read two of Markoff's books in the mid-1990s, _Takedown_ and _Cyberpunk_, when I was interested in hacker culture. I don't remember his writing being as stilted as it is in _Whole Earth_, which reads like patched-together interview notes, but I had lower expectations twenty years ago. I've kept at it because the subject is so interesting.
