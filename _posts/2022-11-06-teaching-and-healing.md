I come from a family of doctors, teachers, and social workers. We are people who help other people by teaching and healing. My father did both in his decades as a psychotherapist. My mother was a speech pathologist. My paternal grandfather and great-grandfather were medical doctors.

My maternal grandfather Ken Lehman was an exception. He was an engineer through and through, and inspired me to consider engineering careers.

In my professional life I've tried to be both an engineer and a teacher. I [deeply enjoy]({% post_url 2021-02-14-optimal-experience %}) mentoring students and junior colleagues one-on-one. I've had fewer experiences teaching groups, but I'm working on that.

I would love to combine teaching and engineering with my passion for history. I've been thinking about what form that could take. In a [previous post]({% post_url 2021-02-27-primary-sources %}) I wrote:
