### [What](#what)

"Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grape juice." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine))

### [Why](#why)

You can enjoy wine even if you don't know anything about it, but I've found that learning about wine adds intellectual enjoyment to the sensual aspects.

### [How](#how)

I started learning about wine in earnest as a graduate student in England. Going to a wine shop in Europe is a very different experience than going to a liquor store in the United States. British wine merchants have a tradition of building relationships with their customers and helping them choose wines.

I kept a wine diary with notes about what I enjoyed and why. I found introductory books about regions, varietals, and how to taste wine. I also read popular books about the history of the [Napa Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_Country), the [Judgment of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Paris_(wine)), a biography of [Robert Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Parker_(wine_critic)).

I've met people who are very serious about wine, but I never aspired to be one of them. I'm happy to be a dilettante in many areas of my life, and enjoy things in proportion to the effort I put into them.
