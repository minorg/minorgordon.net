A few weeks ago The Guardian published a [fascinating article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/history-as-a-giant-data-set-how-analysing-the-past-could-help-save-the-future) on cliodynamics, a new field of academic study that models historical patterns using mathematics. That led me to the [Seshat global history databank](http://seshatdatabank.info/) and the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](https://mith.umd.edu/), among other things.

Seshat sounds like something I should be involved in -- an intersection between Computer Science and history.
