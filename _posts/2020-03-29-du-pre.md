Last Sunday the Guardian Observer published ["Inspiring culture: 50 works that changed our critics lives"](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/29/inspiring-culture-50-works-that-changed-our-critics-lives). There are quite a few gems on the list, but my favorite was the short film of [Jacqueline du Pré](https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2015/may/27/schubert-the-trout-watch-a-clip-from-1969-documentary-barenboim-dupre-allegro-films).

I still remember learning about her version of the Elgar concerto and going to [Dussmann](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulturkaufhaus_Dussmann) in Berlin to find a copy, ca. 2004. The whole lower floor was dedicated to classical music. A knowledgeable staff member recommended the recording with Barbirolli as "erste Wahl". I've passed on that recommendation many times in the years since.
