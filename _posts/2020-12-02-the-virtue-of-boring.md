> "Unlike just about everything else in life, 'boring' is actually a  positive attribute when it comes to software! We donâ€™t want our  programs to be spontaneous and interesting; we want them to stick to  the script and predictably accomplish their business goals. In the  words of Google engineer Robert Muth, 'Unlike a detective story, the lack of excitement, suspense, and puzzles is actually a desirable property of source code.'"
