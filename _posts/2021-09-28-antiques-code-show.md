Over my lunch hour I watched ["The Antiques Code Show"](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/antiques-code-show), a webinar hosted by the Department of Computer Science and Technology in Cambridge. It was a series of interviews about notable projects in the history of the department. My favorite was the video about the [EDSAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC) and [Maurice Wilkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkes).

> Professor Andy Hopper: [Maurice] was quite intense in a way. He was intellectually very determined. Maurice's mission was to change the world.

I also enjoyed the interview with Sian Gooding, a graduate student who is developing tools to help people who struggle with literacy.
