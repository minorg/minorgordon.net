description: Ted Nelson's "Computers for Cynics" video series
---

I've been watching [Ted Nelson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) "Computers for Cynics" video series, an alternative view of the history of computing by one of the men who shaped it.

The best episode is ["Hyperhistory"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9PmIkAYhI0), on the history of [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu), [Doug Engelbart's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) ["Mother of All Demos"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos), and the watered-down technologies that become our modern GUIs and the World Wide Web. I didn't know that Project Xanadu was sponsored by [John Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Walker_(programmer)) at Autodesk in the late 1980s. Walker's _The Autodesk File_ is a fascinating account of that era.
