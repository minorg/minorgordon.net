I'm a fan of the various "awesome-" lists on GitHub, like [`awesome-glam-semweb`](https://github.com/ncarboni/awesome-GLAM-semweb), "a curated list of various semantic web and linked data resources for heritage, humanities and art history practitioners".

Recently I found [an awesome-programmers list](https://github.com/rekihattori/awesome-programmers), a collection of links to the Wikipedia pages of various well-known programmers and computer scientists. It's an excellent starting point to explore one of my favorite subjects, the social history of computing.
