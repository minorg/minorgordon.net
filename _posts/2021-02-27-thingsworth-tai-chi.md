### [What](#what)

"Tai chi is an internal Chinese martial art practiced for defense training, health benefits, and meditation." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi))

There are many [styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi#History_and_styles) of Tai Chi, such as the Sun style and the Wu style. I practice the most popular, the [Yang style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang-style_t%27ai_chi_ch%27uan).

### [Why](#why)

I do Tai Chi because it helps me maintain emotional balance. It's very easy to lose this balance when you have young children, a demanding job, and other pressing concerns day in and day out. Taking time to focus on my body and breathing helps me center myself.

I usually practice in the mornings before starting the day, and occasionally in the evenings as well.

### [How](#how)

I first took a beginner's class in Sun style around 2013. Later I took classes to learn the Yang style short form. It's best to learn from a teacher and practice in a group, but early on I also found the Paul Lam videos helpful.

Over the years I've adapted the postures to some cramped spaces, bedrooms and offices. The weather has been nice enough recently that I can also practice outside occasionally, which is much more enjoyable.
