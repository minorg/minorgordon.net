> I was standing alone (criticising) in the middle of the enormous stadium ... 17,000 men, hammering, loudspeakers, amplifiers, four aircraft circling over etc. etc. - all mechanical & horrible - no soul & no romance & no imagination. Here had been played the great football match - even the turf, which is good, was not their [sic] as turf but for football - but at my feet I saw a group of real daisies. Something wet rolled down my cheek - & I am not ashamed of it ... Damn everything except the daisy - I was back in something sane, wholesome & gentlemanly but only for two minutes.

Edward Elgar in a letter to Alice Stuart Wortley

Elgar Birthplace Museum letter 9708, 16 April 1924
