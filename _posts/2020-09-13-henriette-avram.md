This morning I was reading the [Wikipedia entry for Henriette Avram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henriette_Avram), who developed the MARC format for bibliographic data.

> "Avram was often noted for her petite stature, New York accent, and indefatigable drive. She was also an adept leader. 'She was able to foster a cooperative spirit among the computer specialists and librarians on her staff. In her typical fashion, she stepped into the world of libraries and learned libraries' problems, adopting them as her own.'"
>
> "Her first assignment at the Library of Congress (LC) was to analyze cataloging data for computer processing. In keeping with her training at NSA, where she learned 'the prime necessity of thoroughly understanding the subject before tackling the computer solution,' Avram, along with two librarians, began this process by examining the information contained in a catalog record."
