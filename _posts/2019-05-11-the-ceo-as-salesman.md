I just read ["Portrait of the CEO as Salesman"](https://www.inc.com/magazine/19880301/8122.html) as part of a Coursera course. My favorite quote:

> ... the inherent quality of the product itself will inevitably overwhelm all the marketing expertise in the world.

> Why have we ignored this? Because, sad to say, it's a lot easier to differentiate your product through the quality of the marketing than through the quality of the product.
