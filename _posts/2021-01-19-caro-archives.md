Earlier this month the New York Times published an article about [Robert Caro's archives](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/nyregion/robert-caro-archives.html), which have been acquired by the New-York Historical Society.

> 'There's a belief among some - not all - nonfiction writers that all that matters is to get the facts,' Mr. Caro said, reflecting on his continuing quest to find the right words. 'I donâ€™t believe that. I believe that the quality of writing is just as important in nonfiction as in fiction.'
>
> He said he often keeps a note on his desk lamp that reads, 'The only thing that matters is what is on this page.'
