description: Reading John Markoff's history of the personal computer
layout: post
title:  "That man behind the curtain"
---

This week I finished reading John Markoff's [_What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Dormouse_Said). The book covers some of the same territory as Markoff's subsequent [biography of Stewart Brand]({% post_url 2022-03-29-long-now %}), and suffers from the same writing issues. I kept at it again because the subject is fascinating. I particularly enjoyed the passages about [Dan Ingalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ingalls):

> Did the culture or the times have any effect on the discovery [of [bit blit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_blit)]? Ingalls had dabbled in psychedelics and smoked pot to put himself in a more creative, introspective mood. There was no dramatic link as in the case of [Kary Mullis's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kary_Mullis) invention of [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction). Years later, however, when people would ask about the inventive ideas in [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk), Ingalls would joke, "Well, where do you *think* these ideas came from?!"

In the early decades of computing a visionary like [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) needed a hacker like Ingalls to make everything work. [Doug Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) had [Bill English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_English_(computer_engineer)). [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) had [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak).

One of my own role models was another "man behind the curtain". Michael Parkes was the co-author of ["Using Cohort Scheduling to Enhance Server Performance"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/384198.384222) and the primary implementor of the prototype it describes -- ideas I built on for my graduate research.
