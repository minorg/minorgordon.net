Finding "smart and hungry" people, and finding ways to spend larger fractions of my time with them, have been two of the defining challenges of my life. My career choices, my personal projects, and many other choices have been motivated by this.

My kids are "smart and hungry". I love that about them. I've known students and colleagues who are "smart and hungry", too. Collaborating with them, mentoring them, and learning from them in turn has given me immense joy.

Most people seem to lose their hunger as they get older. They are still capable, but their eagerness has diminished, and complacence has set in. It's rare to find "smart and hungry" people past their mid-20s. I've met a few, like [Linda Batty]({% post_url 2020-05-23-linda-batty %}). They impressed me deeply. They are hungry to learn, grow, and broaden their horizons. They are hungry to be better versions of themselves. They are hungry to do good in the world. And they have the ability to make it happen.
