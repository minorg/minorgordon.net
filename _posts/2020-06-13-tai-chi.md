I do Tai Chi in the mornings, Yang style short form. I first took a beginner's class in Sun style around 2013, and learned the Yang style later. It's best to learn from a teacher and practice in a group, but early on I also found the Paul Lam videos helpful.

Over the years I've adapted the postures to some cramped spaces, bedrooms and offices. The weather has been nice enough recently that I can also practice outside occasionally, which is much more enjoyable.

I'm certainly not going to win any competitions for good form, but that's not the point of it for me. I do Tai Chi because it helps me maintain emotional balance. It's very easy to lose this balance when you have young children, a demanding job, and other pressing concerns day in and day out. Taking time to focus on my body and breathing helps me center myself.
