description: "New website for the Paradicms project"
---

The [Paradicms project]({% post_url 2020-08-23-paradicms %}) has matured to the point where I believe it can be more than just [a vehicle for my learning]({% post_url 2020-05-23-personal-projects %}). It can stand on its own and be useful to other people.

I've created a [new website](https://paradicms.org/) for the project, including user documentation (following the [Divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/)) and a Paradicms-focused blog.
