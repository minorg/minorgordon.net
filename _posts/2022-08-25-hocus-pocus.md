I've been reading _Undiluted Hocus-Pocus: The Autobiography of Martin Gardner_. I didn't know he was from Tulsa:

> A geometry class was skillfully taught by Miss Pauline Baker. ... one day during study period ... I was trying to determine which side has the win in tic-tac-toe. Is it the first or the second player, or is it a tie if both sides make their best moves? (Answer: it's a tie.) Pauline snatched away the sheet on which I was scribbling and said sternly, "When you're in my class, I expect you to work on mathematics and nothing else!"
