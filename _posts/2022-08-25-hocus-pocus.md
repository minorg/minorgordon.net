I've been reading _Undiluted Hocus-Pocus: The Autobiography of Martin Gardner_. I didn't know he was from Tulsa:

> Writing the [Mathematical Games] column for more than twenty-five years was one of the greatest joys of my life. If you look over all my columns ..., you'll find that they steadily become more sophisticated mathematically. That was because I was learning math. I had not taken a single math course in college, although I loved the low-level math I learned in high school. And I had always been fond of recreational math ever since I was introduced to it as a boy by Sam Loyd's mammoth _Cyclopedia_ of puzzles.
> 
> One of the pleasures in writing the column was that it introduced me to so many top mathematicians, which of course I was not. Their contributions to my column were far superior to anything I could write, and were a major reason for the column's growing popularity. The secret of its success was a direct result of my ignorance. Even today my knowledge of math extends only through calculus, and even calculus I only dimly compremend. As a result, I had to struggle to understand what I wrote, and this helped me write in ways that others could understand.
