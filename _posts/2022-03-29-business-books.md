Since my [last post]({% post_url 2022-02-14-business-books %}) I've continued to read business books, and have found a few more I enjoy:

* [_First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First,_Break_All_the_Rules) 
* [_How to Win Friends and Influence People_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)
* [_The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team)

There's no revelations in these books. Most of what they have to say is obvious if you think about it and have some experience of corporate environments to reflect on. I read these books as a prompt to do that thinking, and to learn to articulate my experience better.

I've tried a few of Lencioni's other "leadership fables", but he appears to be phoning in the formula of _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_. I had high hopes for _Measure What Matters_, too, but it turned out to be another "book that could have been a blog post". The material is there, but the book needs a much stronger narrative and better writing.

Earlier this year the company I'm working for sponsored a series of meditation workshops. The workshop leader recommended we read [_Search Inside Yourself_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chade-Meng_Tan), which was adapted from a course at Google. I appreciated the "mindfulness meditation for engineers" angle, but I could have done without the "this will make you a more productive drone" spiel that accompanied it.
