From the time I learned to read until my late teens I read fiction almost exclusively. When I got to college I started reading more non-fiction and less fiction, until I stopped reading the latter altogether around 2011. The last novel I read was _Shikasta_ by Doris Lessing, in 2018. My mentor recommended it.

I recently decided to give fiction another chance, and thought I'd try a new genre: romance novels. I found they're like business books in that you have to try two or three in order to find a good one. Here are a few I've enjoyed:

* Kate Clayborn: _Love Lettering_
* Jennifer Crusie: _Bet Me_
* Ali Hazelwood: _The Love Hypothesis_
* Helen Hoang: _The Kiss Quotient_
* Erin Sterling: _The Ex Hex_
* Penny Reid: _Kissing Tolstoy_
* Emily Henry: _Book Lovers_
