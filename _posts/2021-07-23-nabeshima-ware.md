[Nabeshima ware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabeshima_ware) is a type of Japanese pottery produced during the Edo period. I first learned about it several years ago, after wandering across several examples at the San Antonio Museum of Art. Since then I've sought them out in museums I've visited -- the Minneapolis Institute of Art has a few pieces, as does the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City.

Photographs of the wares don't do them justice. When you look at one in person, the designs, the details, and the colors are simply stunning.
