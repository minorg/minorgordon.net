> If you find yourself inspired by your ideal future, I highly recommend talking about it a lot to other people. There are two important benefits. First, the more you talk about it, the more real it becomes to you. This works even if your dream is highly improbable or impossible. My own dream, for example, is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime. ... When I started thinking about this, I knew my goal was impossible, but I talked about it to a lot of people anyway. The more I talked about it, the more it went from being impossible to implausible, and then from implausible to possible, and more importantly, it went from possible to actionable. I reached a state in my mind in which I felt there were actually things I could do to move it forward.

> The second important benefit is the more you talk to people about your ideal future, the more likely you can find people to help you. This is especially true if your aspiration for the future is altruistic in nature because people will rush to help you. If your wish is to drive a nice Lexus, nobody will care. However, if your wish is something altruistic -- for example, you want to feed every hungry person in the world, or you want to make sure no homeless person in San Francisco ever dies from the cold, or you aspire to help disadvantaged kids in your community learn better -- and you are sincere about your wish to serve others, I guarantee the most common response will be, "How can I help?" When you are genuinely moved to help others, you inspire people with your altruism, and when you inspire them, they want to help you.
