> It may be my fate to be a kind of comet, or flaming meteor in science, in the regions of which (like enough to a meteor) I made my appearance very lately, and very unexpectedly; and therefore, like a meteor, it may be my destiny to move very swiftly, burn away with great heat and violence, and become as suddenly extinct.

Joseph Priestley, _Philosophical Empiricism_

<br/>

> Year of comets and meteors transient and strange!â€”lo! <br/>
> even here, one equally transient and strange! <br/>
> As I flit through you hastily, soon to fall and be gone, <br/>
> what is this book, <br/>
> What am I myself but one of your meteors?

Walt Whitman, _Leaves of Grass_
