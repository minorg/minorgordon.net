The local library is open late on Monday evenings. I've been taking my daughter after dinner so she can pick out one or two books to read aloud at bed.

The library is in a beautiful old Episcopal church in Cohoes. The former baptismal space is now occupied by a replica of a [mastodon](https://www.ci.cohoes.ny.us/315/Cohoes-Mastodon).

My daughter is three and a half. My mother started taking me to the Claremore public library around the same age. It was the old [Will Rogers Library](https://claremoremoh.org/1936/01/the-old-will-rogers-library/). Back then they still used double cards to record checkouts, one card for the library and one kept in a pocket attached to the back cover of the book. I remember the sound of the special machine that punched the cards.

That building on Will Rogers Boulevard is now the [Claremore Museum of History](https://claremoremoh.org/). There is a flagpole outside the building commemorating my grandmother, [Elizabeth Gordon](https://www.claremoreprogress.com/news/local_news/stratton-taylor-elizabeth-gordon-to-join-claremore-wall-of-fame/article_ddffc912-37c0-5f10-9cbd-2265554f8948.html), for her service to the community.
