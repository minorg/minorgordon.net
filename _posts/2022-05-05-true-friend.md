> While the obvious theme of this koan about Tortoise Mountain is to point out the unpredictable sources of joy, the other theme is of the true friend. The true friend here is one who surprises or disturbs you in a particular way. As long as you are fixated in a particular direction, the friend may seem like a distraction, or even a nuisance, but when that happens he or she is probably doing a good job of being your friend.
