[A Brief History of the Pythagorean Theorem](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~demo5337/Group3/hist.html):

> "If we take an isosceles right triangle with legs of measure 1, the hypotenuse will measure sqrt 2. But this number cannot be expressed as a length that can be measured with a ruler divided into fractional parts, and that deeply disturbed the Pythagoreans, who believed that 'All is number.' They called these numbers 'alogon,' which means 'unutterable.' So shocked were the Pythagoreans by these numbers, they put to death a member who dared to mention their existence to the public. It would be 200 years later that the Greek mathematician Eudoxus developed a way to deal with these unutterable numbers."
