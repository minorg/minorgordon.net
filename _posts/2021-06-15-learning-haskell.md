I've been learning the [Haskell programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)) for a project at work. I've always been a little intimidated by its reputation, and not without reason. Idiomatic Haskell is like the [second discourse of the Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anattalakkha%E1%B9%87a_Sutta): easy to understand when someone explains it, but hard to [grok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) well enough to write yourself.
