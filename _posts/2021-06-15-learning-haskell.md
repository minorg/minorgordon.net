I've been learning the [Haskell programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)) for a project at work. I've always been a little intimidated by its reputation, and not without reason. Idiomatic Haskell is like the [second discourse of the Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anattalakkha%E1%B9%87a_Sutta): easy to understand when someone explains it, but hard to [grok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) well enough to write yourself. I've enjoyed the challenge, however, and it's given me insight into other languages and tools I use: many features of Scala, functional effects libraries, and list comprehensions (one of my favorite features of Python), among other things.
