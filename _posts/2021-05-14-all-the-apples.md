This week the Guardian published a great [interview with Vincent D'Onofrio](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/may/12/vincent-donofrio-interview-book-mutha-poetry):

> 'One thing everyone I admire has in common is that when actually producing art, they’re aiming to fail,' he says. 'I'm the same way. We’re not aiming to succeed. We’re aiming to reach the mindset where you’ve learned something, rather than had something affirmed, so the goal must be to fail. You forget that failure is the thing that keeps you going, not the thing that stops you. If I'm on a set, take by take, I aim to fail. I go all the way. It doesn’t mean 'big', just that whatever my plan is, I do not think, 'I'm going to get it this time.' I don't give a shit. That's how you get it.
