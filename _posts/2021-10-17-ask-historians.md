For the last few months I've been casually reading the archives of the [AskHistorians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/AskHistorians) subreddit. There is a fair bit of dross (e.g., Nazi-related questions), but the sheer breadth of the topics and expertise on display makes up for that. For someone who's as interested in as many history-related subjects as I am, it's a gold mine.

I enjoy my dilettantism -- learning a little about a lot of things. I've only made deeper commitments to a few subjects in my life, like my graduate research in Computer Science. My preference for breadth over depth has been reflected in my career. One of the reasons I studied Computer Science is that it [affords so many different opportunities]({% post_url 2021-07-19-bifurcation %}).

My aspiration is to be a "jack of all trades", but I certainly don't want to be a "master of none". It's very easy for "learning a little about a lot of things" to become "only dealing in the superficial". I've become more aware of this tendency in the last year or two.

[This AskHistorians post about "big history" books](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/puu8n9/how_to_discern_good_big_history_books_from_bad/) reminded me of that. Although I haven't read many of those books -- I find them to be too vague and reductive to be engaging -- I've certainly been guilty of consuming too much bad history with an uncritical eye. Most of my non-job-related reading time is at the end of the day, when I'm tired and can't concentrate well. It's very easy to get into a habit of choosing books because they're light reads, yet still give you the feeling that you've learned something -- even if you haven't learned anything, or worse, what you've learned is simply wrong.

I have a similar issue with job-related learning, albeit for different reasons. Outside of academia there's rarely enough time to study important questions properly. It's tempting to reach for a superficial overview of some subject and tell yourself you've learned enough for your immediate needs.

I see a number of ways I can respond to that, between the extremes of giving up reading (never going to happen) and only reading works intended for a critical academic audience (impractical). I'd like to be more circumspect about which authors I read, and less distracted by gimmicks. I'd also like to read more primary sources and original thought. I've spent too much time reading broad overviews and pablumized accounts.

That will likely mean focusing on fewer areas. One recent example is children's education. I've been reading several authors whom Bret Victor references in his talks: [John Taylor Gatto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto), [John Holt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Holt_(educator)), [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert), and [Jerome Bruner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bruner). It's been refreshing to read about these authors' ideas in their own words.
