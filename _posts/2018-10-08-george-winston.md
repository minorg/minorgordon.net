Last night I went to see [George Winston](http://www.georgewinston.com/concerts/claremore-ok-robson-performing-arts-center-263/) perform at the Performing Arts Center in my home town, Claremore, Oklahoma. He played the "winter" set, with some tracks from _December_ and many others. It was lovely.

My mother first shared _December_ with me when I was 11 or 12. She got to see George Winston in concert around that time, in Oklahoma City.  I've always wanted to go to one of Winston's concerts myself, but for years he rarely ventured beyond the northern states.

It was also my first time at the Robson Performing Arts Center, which was built after I left Claremore. I was impressed by the place, and by the Robsons' generosity. The Robsons were long-time benefactors of the schools in Claremore. They purchased the first computers for my elementary school in Claremore. I took to the Apple IIe's immediately -- there was a photo of me using one in the Claremore paper.
