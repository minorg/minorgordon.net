This weekend I finished Fiona MacCarthy's [new biography of Walter Gropius](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/25/walter-gropius-bauhaus-fiona-maccarthy-review). Gropius was a modern architect and the founder of the Bauhaus. Before I started the book I only knew a little about the subject. As an undergraduate in Berlin I took a class on 20th century design, taught by the then-president of the Bauhaus Archive. I'd also read some of Alma Mahler-Werfel's autobiography _Mein Leben_.

Gropius's connections to other architects and designers were particularly fascinating: working closely with [Marcel Breuer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Breuer), teaching at [Black Mountain College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountain_College) alongside [Buckminster Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller), jousting with [Frank Lloyd Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright), and touring Japan and the [Katsura Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsura_Imperial_Villa) as an urban planning advisor after the war.

MacCarthy portrays Gropius as a great man who was thwarted by circumstances far too many times: the rise of the Nazis, the British not appreciating modern architecture when Gropius tried to get commissions there after fleeing the Nazis, fall-outs with colleagues. Gropius also made some poor decisions, like marrying Alma Mahler. Directing the Bauhaus was a greater accomplishment than most people could hope for in a lifetime, but the book made me wonder how much more Gropius could have done, given the right opportunities.

I'm looking forward to reading MacCarthy's biographies of William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. The latter is one of my favorite artists. Unfortunately my copies of those books are in storage, so I'll be starting John Julius Norwich's multi-volume history of Byzantium next. I loved his _History of France_, both the content and the style. I've been discovering historians of the previous generation; I find them more relatable than many of the popular historians writing today, who often try to "jazz up" history in order to appeal to a broader audience, and lose something in the process. History is fascinating enough already.
