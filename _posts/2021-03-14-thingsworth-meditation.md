### [What](#what)

"Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state. Scholars have found meditation elusive to define, as practices vary both between traditions and within them." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation))

### [Why](#why)

As the Wikipedia definition says, a person can meditate in order "to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state".

My work can be very intellectually stimulating, and requires many different kinds of thinking to do well. Sometimes it's difficult to calm my mind at the end of the day. I've found that meditation helps me do that. When things get really intense it also helps to pause and re-focus.

### [How](#how)

There are many different meditation techniques. I prefer _vipassana_-meditation, as described in the book [_Mindfulness in Plain English_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henepola_Gunaratana). [Joseph Goldstein's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goldstein_(writer)) books are also good, such as _Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Awakening_.

It took me a while to find a technique that works for me. The important thing is to try them and practice, rather than holding out for the perfect system.
