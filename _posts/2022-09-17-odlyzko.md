A work discussion this week reminded me of [Andrew Odlyzko's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Odlyzko) essay ["Content is Not King"](https://firstmonday.org/article/view/833/742). I came across Odlyzko's [work on network economics](http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/complete.html) around 2006, when I was in grad school and casting about for a research topic. I read the papers he had published until then, then followed his work for the next several years.

The arc of Odlyzko's research interests is fascinating: pure mathematics, network economics, financial bubbles, and cybersecurity, among other topics.
