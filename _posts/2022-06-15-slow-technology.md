description: Impressions of the paper "Slow Technology - Designing for Reflection"
---

This week I read ["Slow Technology - Designing for Reflection"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/PL00000019) after seeing it referenced in another paper. "Slow Technology" was published over 20 years ago, but the concrete parts are still interesting:

> We have experimented with displaying time structures in terms of various "clocks", for example a clock inspired by Klein’s monochromes, where colours and time structures interpret certain properties of given information  and a clock slowly displays time in terms of small changes in colour of a simple geometrical structure [28]. Inspired by the paintings of Mondrian (Fig. 4), we have experimented with mapping the dynamics of information structures onto the geometrics of Mondrian-like displays. We have also used techniques such as generative grammars and Lindenmayer systems (e.g. [31] and Fig. 5) to be able to map  information to the complexity of a pattern or composition [28].

It's the first I've heard of [Lindenmayer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system). Formal grammars were my favorite part of the computer science curriculum, and I've used them often in my work (parsing, compilers for domain-specific languages, etc.).
