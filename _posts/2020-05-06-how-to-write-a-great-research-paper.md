description: Simon Peyton-Jones's talks for new researchers

For the group meeting this week I suggested we review Simon Peyton Jones's recorded talk on ["How to write a great research paper"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/). Peyton Jones gives this talk every year to incoming graduate students in Cambridge; I heard it in 2005. I particularly like the advice on writing abstracts, which came from Kent Beck (["How to get a paper accepted at OOPSLA"](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/research/beckOOPSLA.html)).

"How to write a great research paper" has two companion talks, "How to give a great research talk" and "How to write a great research proposal." I've never seen one of Peyton Jones's research proposals, but his talks and papers are excellent.

At the group meeting one of my colleagues suggested Patrick Winston's ["How to Speak" lecture](https://ocw.mit.edu/how_to_speak) as a follow-up.
