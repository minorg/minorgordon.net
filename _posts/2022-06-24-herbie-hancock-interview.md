This morning the Guardian published an interview with Herbie Hancock, who's playing at Glastonbury this year.

> He said [hoarse, Miles-ish whisper]: "I don’t pay you to just play to get applause." He told us he paid us to experiment on stage. He said: "I want you to try new things, brand new stuff." And I told him, some of it’s maybe not going to work, so what about the audience then? He said: "Don’t worry about it. I got the audience." He loved being challenged, being stimulated, being thrown a curveball. It’s like playing baseball: he was the homerun king, ready to strike any ball and send it over the stands.
