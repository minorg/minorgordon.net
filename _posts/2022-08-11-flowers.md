It's the eighth week of the CSA. The days have cooled but are still sunny. The light was perfect this evening.

Sunflowers are so bombastic that they're challenging to photograph in interesting ways. I focused on the undersides instead. I like the details, especially the dark edges under the peach-colored flower.
