> They divided the subject on which they were working into unnumerable small parts and then let each part be handled by a student. The student's task under these circumstances was relatively easy, and was dealt with in great detail so as to create an impression of being important. In this way there arose what was known in Germany as the 'Betrieb' (mill), where to all outward appearances no distinction is made between worthwhile ideas and trivialities. Everything produced was a 'contribution to the literature,' which had to be cited by every other subsequent writer if he wanted to be 'scientific'. An agreeable feeling of activity surrounded both teacher and students. They became so engrossed in this activity and industry that the larger problem that the partial studies were supposed to elucidate was often forgotten. The production of dissertations and papers became an end in itself.

(Philipp Frank, _Einstein: His Life and Times_)

Like many people I started my career with a surplus of time and energy and poor judgment about how to spend them. I put considerable effort into solving problems that weren't worth it. With age and experience I've learned to be more conscientious about what I focus on. I ask questions like

**Why does the problem exist?** I try to avoid [pseudo-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_job), [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), and other problems that arise from organizational dysfunction rather than client/customer/user needs.

**Who would benefit from a new solution?** It's tempting to extrapolate from your own experience and assume other people share your perspective and priorities. They rarely do. It pays to do [user research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_research).

**How much do they need one?** People will complain about the status quo but very few of them are willing to try new things. The benefits of switching has to be well worth the effort for them.

**Are the requirements for a [minimum viable solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) clear? And validated?** Beware of [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) and unvalidated requirements.

**Are the constraints on a solution essential?** You can waste a lot of time and energy on constraints that aren't [essential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_complexity) to the problem, like poor tool choices.

**Can someone with less knowledge/skill/talent than me solve this problem?** I prefer to focus on problems that strike a balance between ["the challenge of the task and the skill of the performer"]({% post_url 2021-02-14-optimal-experience %}).

**Will someone else solve the problem if I don't?** There are many situations where you care more about the result than about the process of reaching it.

**Are there other problems I should prioritize over this problem?** Considering [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost), [urgency vs. importance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Eisenhower_method), Return on Investment (ROI), and other criteria.
