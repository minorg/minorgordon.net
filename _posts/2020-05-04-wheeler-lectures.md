During my lunch hours I've been watching videos of the [Wheeler lectures](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/seminars/wheeler). These started several years after I graduated. I only learned about them a few months ago.

The lecture by Andrew Herbert on the history of virtualization technologies was especially enjoyable. I love listening to computer science war stories, like the ones Robert Sedgewick intersperses in his Algorithms lectures on Coursera.
