description: Considering people as individuals and having a healthy skepticism of credentials
---

One of the most valuable things my father taught me was the importance of focusing on individual people and their specific qualities.  You can cultivate a relationship with a person. You can trust and rely on an individual -- or not. You have to come to your own conclusions by observing what the person says and does and what other people say.

That's hard work, and there are no reliable shortcuts around it. Specifically, there is no impersonal credential -- a degree, a certification, a CV entry  -- that will consistently save you from having to think and use your own judgment on a case-by-case basis. At best a credential represents the average of the people who bear it. More often it represents a minimum standard.

Case-by-case decisions, in contrast, will inevitably be inconsistent and probably biased to some degree. That's why so many bureaucratic processes rely on abstractions like degrees, on the assumption that it's better to consistently get the average, or more likely the minimum, that a credential connotes, than to rely on the vagaries of human judgment. "No one ever got fired for choosing IBM."

I have my share of degrees and professional associations. They are useful in certain box-ticking situations. Beyond that I don't rely on them, and I refuse to be a box-ticker myself. Some of the best people I've ever worked with never went to college. Most have never worked at any of the high-profile places you see people advertise on their resumes as "Ex-" this and "Ex-" that. Those signifiers are irrelevant to whether I'd want someone as a client, colleague, or boss.

My career, like my father's before me, has been a story of seeking out great individuals and betting on them. Likewise, my best professional experiences have come when individuals bet on me and not on my credentials.

That approach hasn't been easy or obvious. Compared to my father's generation, more people today rely on imprimaturs that are less meaningful than they've ever been. We have become de-personalized. I ascribe much of that trend to the mediation of technology, the encroachment of large institutions into more areas of our lives, and our apparently compulsive need for every process to "scale" consistently. Getting to know and trust an individual and cultivating a non-transactional relationship with that person is inherently un-scalable, but it's much more rewarding for that.
