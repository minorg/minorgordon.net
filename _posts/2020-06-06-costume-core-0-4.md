title:  "Costume Core 0.4"

Last year I wrote about [DressDiscover]({% post_url 2019-12-22-dressdiscover %}), a suite of open source web applications for digital collections of historic clothing.

Recently my collaborator on DressDiscover, Arden Kirkland, has been working on a [new version of Costume Core](http://www.ardenkirkland.com/costumecore/version-0-4/), her ontology for describing artifacts of historic clothing. The new release includes an [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) ontology that formally describes Costume Core and links its properties to other vocabularies such as [VRA Core](https://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/) and [Dublin Core](https://dublincore.org/). Arden was able to use the OWL ontology as a schema for [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/), a Content Management System for digital cultural heritage collections.

Costume Core addresses a need for a consistent way of describing garments in collection databases. I plan to incorporate the new ontology into the DressDiscover worksheet and other projects I've been working on in this space.
