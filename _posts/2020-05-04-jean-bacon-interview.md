I recently found [this video interview](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/214756) with my doctoral advisor, Jean Bacon, from September 2008. That was shortly before I defended my dissertation.

She's such a lovely person, and whip-smart. A rare combination. I wish I'd appreciated this more at the time.
