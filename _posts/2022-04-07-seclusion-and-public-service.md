> Before he died, Chu-ko Liang offered his son this advice on how to resolve the conflicting demands of seclusion and public service:
>
> **The course of a gentleman is to cultivate his person through tranquillity and to nourish his virtue through honesty. Unless he is calm, his ideals cannot manifest themselves. Unless he is still, his influence cannot reach far. Learning requires tranquillity, and ability requires learning. If not through learning, he has no means to broaden himself. If not through ideals, he has no means to complete his learning. If he is dissolute, he cannot rouse his spirit. If he is rash, he cannot govern his nature. While he is still young, he spurs himself on. While he still can, he completes his work. Decay seldom receives the world's sympathy. What can he accomplish, if he remains in seclusion?**
> 
> And on this point has hinged the major difference among followers of the Tao: to serve or not to serve, to hide one's light or to let it shine forth -- assuming, as Matthew Arnold once put it, that "one's light be not darkness." The difference has been not so much a matter of philosophy as of temperament and perception. The aim has remained the same: the application of the principles of the Tao to human affairs. This was true for Confucius, for Ch'u Yuan, for Po-yi and Shu-ch'i, as well as for Chang Liang, the Four Worthies, and Chu-ko Liang. While a period of relative seclusion was considered essential  to understand these principles, and seclusion sometimes lasted a lifetime, the aim remained the establishment and extension of harmony in the world.

> Seclusion and public service were seen as the dark and light of the moon, inseparable and complementary. Hermits and officials were often the same people at different times of their lives. And officials who never experienced tranquillity and concentration of spirit in pursuits other than fame or fortune were not esteemed in China. The Chinese have always looked to hermits as among their greatest social benefactors and have encouraged rather than discouraged their pursuit of the Tao, however unconventional and reclusive such pursuit might seem. Whether or not they have come out of retirement to serve, hermits have influenced the entire culture as springs of pure thinking and pure living that sooner or later find their way to town.
