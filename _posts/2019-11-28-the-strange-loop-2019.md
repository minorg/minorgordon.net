description: Interesting talks from The Strange Loop conference
---

I didn't make [The Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2019/sessions.html) this year, unfortunately. I've been watching some of the talks on YouTube.

Emery Berger's [Performance Matters](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2019/performance-matters.html) has been making the rounds, and is well worth the time. I used Dr. Berger's Hoard allocator in the experiments for my dissertation. Listening to his talk made me miss my former life a little -- benchmarking, performance analysis, and optimization -- though I still prefer what I do now, focusing on applications rather than infrastructure.

There's also an interesting talk about the [New York Times Crossword](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2019/behind-the-new-york-times-crossword.html). I didn't know that Will Shortz [has a degree in enigmatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Shortz#Early_life_and_education), the study of puzzles.
