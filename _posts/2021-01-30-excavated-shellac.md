This week the Guardian published an [album review](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/26/kyrgyzstan-ballads-okinawan-folk-ugandan-hymns-the-album-rewriting-global-music-history-excavated-shellac) of [_Excavated Shellac: An Alternate History of the World’s Music (1907-1967)_](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/26/kyrgyzstan-ballads-okinawan-folk-ugandan-hymns-the-album-rewriting-global-music-history-excavated-shellac), a collection that "highlights music that is often invisible in today's world - the incredible world of global recordings that aren't jazz, blues, country, rock ‘n roll, R&B, or 'classical.'"

The review includes an interview with the collector behind the album, Jonathan Ward, who's described as "a Los Angeles-based 'metadata tsar' who works in the field of museum documentation". Ward is an editor of the [Getty Vocabularies](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/index.html), one of the most important sources of metadata for cultural heritage.
