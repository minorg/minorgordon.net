I just finished reading _Coming of Age: The Story of Our Century by Those Who've Lived It_, an oral history published in 1995 by [Studs Terkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studs_Terkel). He interviewed people who were 70 or older at the time, whose lives spanned the 20th century. He spoke with some fascinating people, like [Abraham Lincoln Marovitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_Marovitz), [Helen Nearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Nearing), and [Sophia Mumford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Mumford).

I've read a number of Studs Terkels's oral histories, and enjoyed them all: [_Working_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_(Terkel_book)), [_"The Good War"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_War), [_Hard Times_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Times:_An_Oral_History_of_the_Great_Depression). I first learned about him from his appearances in [Ken Burns's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns) documentaries.
