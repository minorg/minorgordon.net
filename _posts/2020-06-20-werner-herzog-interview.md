Yesterday the Guardian published a [great interview with Werner Herzog](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/19/werner-herzog-im-fascinated-by-trash-tv-the-poet-must-not-avert-his-eyes).

> Ideally, he would be out on a shoot right now. Until then there are books. Herzog reads voraciously; he says that all the good directors do.

...

> Does he read in English or German? 'Ha,' he says, as though I have fallen into his trap. 'I read in other languages, too. I read in Spanish and I read in Latin and I read in ancient Greek and I read in, er, whatever. But it doesn’t matter. It depends on the text. I mean, take, for instance, Hölderlin, the greatest of the German poets. You cannot touch him in translation. If you’re reading Hölderlin, you must learn German first.'

...

> So does he think that speaking in a second language somehow makes him more respectful and considerate?""
>
> 'Ha,' says Herzog, The pedant pounces. 'English is not my second language. My second language is German.'
>
> Fine, I say. Third language then.
>
> 'Ha,' says Herzog. 'My third language is Latin.' No question can pin him, no lockdown can hold him. He will keep reading, raging, sparring clear through until Christmas.

I recall reading something similar in Akira Kurosawa's autobiography. Kurosawa was a voracious reader. Ideas he had read and thought about would filter through his dreams, which he would record and later incorporate into his films. One of Kurosawa's last films, _Dreams_, was a series of vignettes about these dreams.
