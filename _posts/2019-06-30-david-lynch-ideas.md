The Guardian recently [interviewed David Lynch](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/30/david-lynch-interview-manchester-international-festival) about his season at the Manchester international festival. I love this quote:

> __You’ve often described creative ideas as fish. Are the fish biting at the moment?__

> Well, as you know if you ever fished, you have to have patience – some days you catch some, some days you don’t. I am fishing now, and I’m gathering fish together, but I haven’t started cooking them. Right now, I’d say the ideas are in the world of sculpture and painting.
