I like to watch Coursera courses while I'm eating lunch, especially on the weekends. I recently found one called "Buddhism and Modern Psychology"; it was previously titled "The Science of Meditation". The course is taught by [Robert Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wright_(journalist)), an author who focuses on the intersection of evolutionary psychology and religion.

Alongside the course I've been reading Wright's _Why Buddhism is True_, which covers much of the same ground. The Coursera readings reference that and other lectures that are worth hearing, such as [Bhikkhu Bodhi's talks on the dharma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZu3ZNWvFiw).

Wright's book describes a number of silent meditation retreats he experienced at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, MA, about two and a half hours east of where I live. Oliver Burkeman talks about his experiences at the same center in his book _The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking_. I would love to go there some day.
