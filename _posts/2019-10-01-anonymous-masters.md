In spare moments I've been reading Wikipedia's pages about [anonymous masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anonymous_masters). I found a few of the pages fascinating:

* [Master of Calamarca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Calamarca)

* [Master of the Osservanza Triptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Osservanza_Triptych)
