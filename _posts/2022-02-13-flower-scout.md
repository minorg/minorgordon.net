A cursory reading of my posts here would suggest I'm not the type to praise anything effusively, but I've been inordinately pleased to find a local florist I like, [Flower Scout](http://www.flower-scout.com/). We have one of her arrangements for Valentine's Day:

It's lovely.

In my salad days as a hopeless romantic I fancied becoming a florist myself. It's probably best that didn't pan out, since I'm not much for weddings or funerals. [Some things are better suited for hobbies](2021-06-05-thingsworth-flower-arranging.md).
