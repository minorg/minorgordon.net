Last night I saw the [Philadelphia Orchestra and Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis](https://spac.org/event/the-philadelphia-orchestra-15/) at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center (SPAC). It was my first time in Saratoga, and my second hearing the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra.

Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra started with a masala of Duke Ellington pieces before the intermission, then came back with the Philadelphia Orchestra to perform Marsalis's own _Swing Symphony_. Although the latter had some highlights, I would have been happy to hear more Duke Ellington instead. Wynton Marsalis's and Victor Goines's solos were particularly good. The encore after the _Swing Symphony_, where members of the jazz band as well as the symphony took solos, was a great way to end the evening.

The venue was just right, too: open air under a roof on a summer evening, crickets competing with the orchestra.
