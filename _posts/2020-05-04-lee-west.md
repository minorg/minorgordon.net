This weekend my father told me to find [Lee West's obituary](https://www.tulsaworld.com/obituaries/localobituaries/hon-lee-r-west/article_24196a7e-902b-5f11-9272-039f2a5f6e1d.html) in the Tulsa paper. Lee was a friend of my grandfather M.E. Gordon from their field trial days. They are both in the Field Trial Hall of Fame in Grand Junction, Tennesee.

That sounds about right.
