Dr. Minor William Gordon, age 74, of Claremore, Oklahoma, passed away Saturday, November 20, 2021 at St. John's Medical Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Celebration Of Life Service will be held 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM on Thursday, December 2nd at Rice Funeral Service, with Jerry Book officiating.

Minor was born August 24, 1947 in Claremore, Oklahoma. He was the son of Dr. Minor Elliott and Elizabeth (Kilgore) Gordon. He married the love of his life, Jane Marguerite Gordon, on March 1, 2001 during a trout fishing trip to Benton County, Arkansas.

Minor was proud to be a life-long citizen of Claremore. After graduating from Claremore High School in 1965, he attended Northeastern Oklahoma State University, the University of Central Oklahoma, and the University of Southern Mississippi, where he earned his doctoral degree in Psychology in 1976. Minor started his own clinical psychology practice in 1981, and dedicated his life to serving the residents of Claremore and Tulsa.

Dr. Gordon was a gardener and fan of the Oklahoma Sooners, finding solace in his fall garden when the team had a tough loss. Despite having no great interest in playing golf, Minor was passionate about making the game accessible to the community, as the proprietor of the Gordon Golf Course. Minor also enjoyed fishing with his friends and family, and teaching people to “fish for a lifetime”.

Minor loved to tell stories and did so to great effect, using anecdotes to illustrate a point. One of Minor’s favorite stories involved driving his father’s new Thunderbird and a police chase through town, which culminated in a lesson about respecting the community and the advantages of a custom suspension.

Minor has been preceded in death by his parents. He is survived by his loving wife, Jane; sons, Dr. Minor Elliott Gordon and wife Dr. Jennifer Farley Gordon, William Jacob Gordon and wife Kjerstine Anjel (KJ) Gordon, and Todd Lehman Gordon; daughters, Amelia Elizabeth Gordon and April Dawn Glasco; brother, Elliott Gordon; grandchildren, Elizabeth Gale Gordon, Minor Kenneth Gordon, Kohda Esteban Gordon, Adam Henry Gordon, Lincoln Edwin Gordon, and Devin Mason Clagg; along with a host of family and friends.
