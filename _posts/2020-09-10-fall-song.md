This season we subscribed to a [Community-supported Agriculture (CSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture) share from [Dension Farm](https://www.denisonfarm.com/): fresh fruit, vegetables, and eggs everywhere. It's been awesome.

Every week the farm sends out a newsletter about what to expect that week in our share, news about the farm, and recipes. This week the newsletter included a poem by [Mary Oliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Oliver), "Fall Song":

    Another year gone, leaving everywhere
    its rich spiced residues: vines, leaves,
    
    the uneaten fruits crumbling damply
    in the shadows, unmattering back
    
    from the particular island
    of this summer, this Now, that now is nowhere
    
    except underfoot, moldering
    in the black subterranean castle
    
    of unobservable mysteries—roots and sealed seeds
    and the wanderings of water. This
    
    I try to remember when time’s measure
    painfully chafes, for instance when autumn
    
    flares out at the last, boisterous and like us longing
    to stay— how everything lives, shifting
    
    from one bright vision to another, forever
    in these momentary pastures.

I haven't read much poetry since I was in college. Just by coincidence I discovered Mary Oliver's work a few months ago, after seeing an article in The Guardian that linked to [her obituary](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/15/mary-oliver-obituary). "What blazes the trail is not necessarily pretty."
