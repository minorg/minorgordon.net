The Guardian has been running a series called "Listener's Digest", exploring the works of great musicians. I especially appreciated this article about the back catalogue of [Ravi Shankar](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/01/ravi-shankar-where-to-start-in-his-back-catalogue). I've always wanted to learn more about his music but found it hard to approach.

There's another good one about [Kraftwerk](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/23/kraftwerk-listeners-digest-german-electronic-music-back-catalogue).
