I've been listening to an awesome Spotify playlist of tracks that were later sampled by hip-hop artists: "Atomic Dog", "Funky Drummer", et al. The music spans several genres, and almost all of it is great. I've enjoyed the history lesson, and it's fun to be reminded of the hip-hop tracks that came later.

[RZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RZA) put together a similar compilation in the early 2000s, [Shaolin Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Soul) -- tracks sampled by the Wu-Tang Clan.

There's a series of comic books/graphic novels called [Hip Hop Family Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_Hop_Family_Tree), about early hip hop culture, that is worth reading. The Wikipedia article says it was inspired by R. Crumb's "Heroes of Blues, Jazz & Country", which I also loved.
