In his autobiography [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner) talks about meeting [Ben Reitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Reitman) in Chicago. That Wikipedia page led me to [James Eads How](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Eads_How) and [hobo colleges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Brotherhood_Welfare_Association#Hobo_colleges):

> The hobo colleges, which How started in several cities, primarily offered lodging and meals, but as the name implies also education and a place to meet. The education would be scheduled certain nights and included basic social science, industrial law, vagrancy laws, public speaking, searching for jobs, venereal disease and anything that may be understood and useful for the hobos. They also covered subjects like philosophy, literature and religion. The lectures were held by street orators as well as academics. How often talked about social politics subjects such as 8-hour working day, pensions and unemployment. The discussions following were known to be very lively. They also served as community meeting places where the homeless workers could express themselves. It was held mainly in winter when there were fewer jobs and more hobos in the cities. The success of the "colleges" varied. The Chicago branch was the biggest and one year debated with University of Chicago students. A hobo college was usually a rented building in the hobo area of a city. There would be blankets for sleeping, a washroom and a kitchen, where the hobos cooked their favorite mulligan stew.
