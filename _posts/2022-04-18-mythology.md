Some of my earliest reading memories are of stories from Greco-Roman and Norse mythology. I would read any book of myths I could find, usually at our local library in Claremore. I was drawn to the larger-than-life characters, but too young to have any critical understanding of the subtexts.

I look back on it now and wonder why my parents didn't question the violence and misogyny of these stories. I would like my kids to be able to enjoy them without that. 

I've been glad to discover new versions of the myths that dispense with those elements. Charlotte Higgins recently published [_Greek Myths: A New Retelling_](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/29/greek-myths-a-new-retelling-by-charlotte-higgins-review-gloriously-interwoven-tales), and Stephen Fry has a three book series. Neil Gaiman's versions of the Norse myths are also excellent.
