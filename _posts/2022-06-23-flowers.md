[Flower Scout's](http://www.flower-scout.com/) CSA started today. I've been looking forward to it.

I made a simple arrangement using a [bowl with a kenzan](2022-02-13-flower-scout.md) she sells in the studio. These were the shorter stems. It's a bit busy but I like it. I'll make another in a few days.

The day was cloudy with light rain off and on -- one of my favorite kinds of weather. The light was perfect.
