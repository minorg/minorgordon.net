"Serenade" has become my favorite of the [radio programs]({% post_url 2021-02-14-radio %}) I listen to regularly. It's "a program of classical music featuring nocturnes, adagios and andantes produced by Wayne Henning" on [WMHT-FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMHT-FM) every Saturday night from 10 to 11 PM.

I've enjoyed every piece I've heard on "Serenade". The production is also wonderful.  I wish the programs were aired more often, or archived online. The WMHT-FM schedule only lists the title, "Serenade", with no further information. I wrote to the station last year asking about playlists but never received a response.

My guess is that the programs were recorded years ago. It's hard to tell, since Henning makes no references to times or places. It might be possible to date the show from the dates of the recordings he announces, but then it's normal for classical stations to play recordings that are decades old.

I haven't been able to find much information about Wayne Henning, either. He appears to have been associated with the CBC in Canada as late as 2020.
