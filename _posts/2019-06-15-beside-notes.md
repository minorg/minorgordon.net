Most of my personal reading time these days is just before bed. I have a notepad there to write down things I'd like to find out more about.

* [Harold von Braunhut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_von_Braunhut), creator of the Amazing Sea Monkeys and X-Ray Specs. I was reading a book about the fishing industry.
* [Claus Sluter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_Sluter), Dutch sculptor
* [St. Gerasimos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerasimus_of_Kefalonia)
* [Criterion velocity](https://medium.com/@enagoski/despair-and-its-cure-1befc3ae8717)
* [Simonyi, _A Cultural History of Physics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1roly_Simonyi)
* [Moral foundations theory](https://moralfoundations.org/)
* [Poggio Bracciolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poggio_Bracciolini), Italian humanist scholar. I was reading a book about the Medici.
* [Jay Laurence Lush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Laurence_Lush), animal geneticist at Iowa State. Also mentioned in the fish book.
* [Madame Recamier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliette_R%C3%A9camier)

* [Mirandola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Pico_della_Mirandola)
* [Mike Oldfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Oldfield)
* [Pindar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindar)'s Pythian Odes. I tried a poorly-written biography of Nietzsche, who was a professor of philology. It said his favorite quote was Pindar: "Become what you are, having learned what that is."
