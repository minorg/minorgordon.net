description: Reflections on modeling historical events
---

I've been thinking about the nature of historical events, and how to model them: space and time, agents and entities, facts versus interpretations. This problem is central to several projects I'm working on.

Yesterday I read a paper by Shaw et al., ["LODE: Linking Open Descriptions of Events"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10871-6_11), that compares existing event ontologies such as [CIDOC CRM]({% post_url 2020-09-10-cidoc-crm %}), the [ABC Ontology](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-ABC-Ontology-and-Model-Lagoze-Hunter/a5f4857e130d235d2b36b25cfa31fbd2bad3ee3a), and the [Event Ontology](http://motools.sourceforge.net/event/event.html) and synthesizes an interchange ontology for events. Shaw later developed [PeriodO](https://perio.do/en/), a "gazetteer of scholarly definitions of historical, art-historical, and archaeological periods".

These things can quickly stray into philosophy. As an implementor my goal is to capture the semantics of events well enough to visualize them. The British Museum's [ResearchSpace](https://www.researchspace.org/publications.html) group has worked in this area, as has Eero Hyv√∂nen's [Semantic Computing Research Group](https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/), among others.

The term "event" has many connotations for me. My graduate research focused on event-driven servers, where an "event" is an incoming request, a message passed between processing elements, a closure, or a signal from the operating system. I worked in a distributed systems group, which at the time was focusing on [distributed event-based systems](https://debs.org/). In those contexts "event" has a purely technical meaning. I'll admit I was more comfortable with that than epistemological questions, but I still enjoy the latter.
