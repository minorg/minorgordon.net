After Boone Pickens died last September I saw a [video of a talk he gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeiSXpmMQys) at our alma mater, Oklahoma State University, which spurred me to read his last memoir, _The First Billion is the Hardest_.

I don't agree with much of Boone's politics, some of the ways he made his money, or his corny graphics, but I appreciated the reminder to stick to your values and be proud of where you come from.
