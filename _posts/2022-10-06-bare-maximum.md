I just finished Alec Nevala-Lee's new biography, _Inventor of the Future: The Visionary Life of Buckminster Fuller_. The new book is decidedly less hagiographic than Lloyd Steven Siedens's _Buckminster Fuller's Universe_, which I read a couple of years ago.

Nevala-Lee's book discussed Fuller's concept of a _bare maximum_, which Fuller defined as "the minimum needed to live up to your full potential". I've been thinking about what that means to me, personally and professionally.
