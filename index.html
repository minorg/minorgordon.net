            <h3>Professional</h3>
            <p>
                I am a software and solutions engineer, technical lead, thinker-doer, and occasional flower arranger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since earning my Ph.D. in Computer Science I've worked in industrial research, small businesses and startups, and academia. I thrive in situations that require lateral thinking, wearing multiple hats, and dealing with ambiguity while still creating value.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time I like to learn new technologies and technical skills and use them to improve access to our cultural heritage online.</p>
